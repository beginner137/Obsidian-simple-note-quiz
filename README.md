## Simple Note Quiz 

This is a plugin that creates a simple quiz and makes marks on your current note just like the tests you took at school. 

## Story
- I like to write notes in question and answer format. 
- I believe testing myself is one of the best ways to learn, I want to create a quiz on my current note, but I don't want to make things too complicated. 
- I want to make marks so that I know which parts I already know and which parts I don't. 

## How it works?
- The plugin parses the note into cards that each contains a question and its answer.
- If a line has a 'question mark', it will be parsed as question and contents right below it will be parsed as answer. Together they form a card. 
- The 'question mark' can be customized in settings, the default is '?'
- Cards are separated by newline.
